# OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) Research

## Overview
OpenClaw (originally released as **Clawdbot**) is an open-source, autonomous AI personal assistant. It is designed to be a "proactive" agent that can handle tasks independently without constant user prompts.

## Key Information
- **Developer:** Peter Steinberger (released in late 2025).
- **Name Change:** Renamed from Clawdbot to OpenClaw (and briefly Moltbot) following trademark concerns from Anthropic (makers of Claude).
- **Core Philosophy:** Proactive execution. It doesn't just wait for questions; it handles operations like a digital employee.

## Main Features
- **Messaging Integration:** Supports WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, iMessage, Discord, and Slack.
- **Autonomous Capabilities:**
  - Web research and internet browsing.
  - Calendar and email management.
  - File system operations (reading/writing files).
  - Terminal command execution.
- **Persistent Memory:** Maintains context across sessions to better understand user needs over time.
- **Deployment:** Can be run locally or on private servers for data privacy.

## Security and Risks
- **Extensive Permissions:** Because it can run shell commands and access files/emails, it requires careful sandboxing.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Susceptible to prompt injection and credential leakage if not properly secured.

## Connection to ClawBay
ClawBay aims to be a "集散地" (hub/marketplace) for these types of agents. Users can discover, host, and manage their own "Claws" (OpenClaw instances or similar agents) on the ClawBay platform.
